          How mass killings by US forces after 9/11 boosted support for the

          Afghans who knew little or nothing about the planes flying into towers
          in New York, and certainly had no link at all to al-Qaida, were caught
          up in the war that followed, and that claimed their loved ones year
          after year. <br /> Haji Muhammad Wazir lost almost all his immediate family,
          apart from his four-year-old son in the early hours of 11 March 2012.
          It was more than a decade after the twin towers came down, but they
          were the reason the US military was on his doorstep.<br /> Bales killed his
          wife, four sons, four daughters and two other relatives. He shot the
          children in the head then tried to burn their bodies. <br />“It is very hard
          for me, I still feel like these things are happening right now,” Wazir
          told the Guardian, nearly a decade after the almost unimaginable
          slaughter ripped apart his life. “I am very happy the American forces
          have finally left Afghanistan, and very grateful to Allah for making
          this happen. At last I feel safe.”<br /> Those murders were perhaps the most
          high-profile civilian deaths of the war. But it was not the only time
          foreign forces killed large numbers of women, children and
          non-combatant men, in just this one corner of a single district of
          Afghanistan. <br />Five men from Zangabad who spoke to the Guardian said
          they lost 49 relatives between them in airstrikes and the massacre,
          bloodshed spanning nearly a decade. These terrible losses, repeated in
          many parts of Afghanistan, would prove powerful recruiting tools for
          the Taliban, as they slowly gathered their forces to retake the
          country. <br />“I could not go and fight, because I was the only person left
          from my family to look after my son, but I was supporting them
          financially and in other ways,” Wazir said of the aftermath of his
          tragedy.<br /> The Taliban commander for Panjwai district, Faizani Mawlawi
          Sahab, said each mass killing drove more people into their arms, and
          the slaughter of 2012 provoked particular grief and horror. “Although
          some people were supporting us before, after this incident everyone
          joined or helped us in some way,” he said.
